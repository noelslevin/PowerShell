# Noel's PowerShell scripts

## Introduction
I was asked to share some of my PowerShell scripts online, so I have. I am not an expert in PowerShell, but I do try to use it over the GUI where possible. I haven't shared all my scripts initially as some contain company-specific configuration which needs to be removed first. I will add more as I'm able to, and will edit what's already there to make it better. Like most people, I work with time restrictions, so my primary need is to get things done rather than to produce the best possible code, but I try to do both where possible! If you're trying to get started with PowerShell, this should give you an idea of what can be done. I am not an expert. I'm sure you can do many of these tasks another way, and/or better.
